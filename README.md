## Building a Full Stack NEST + REACT Typescript Application Using CHAT GPT: An Intern's Guide
From the series: No-Code Code

This project was developed as part of the book "Building a Full Stack NEST + REACT Typescript Application Using CHAT GPT: An Intern's Guide". The book guides the reader through the process of building this application, teaching the reader important concepts and best practices for Full Stack web development along the way.

This project is a Full Stack web application called the "Products App" built using React, NestJS, TypeScript, and MySQL Workbench.

The Frontend of the application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, providing a dynamic and responsive user experience.

The Backend of the application is built using NestJS, a framework for building efficient, scalable, and easily maintainable server-side applications. NestJS is built on top of Node.js and makes use of TypeScript, providing a strong typing system for the server-side code. The data for the application is stored in a MySQL database and managed using MySQL Workbench, a database management tool.

In this application, users are able to view information about various products, including their name, description, price, and image. Users are also able to edit and delete product information, as well as add new products to the database. The application makes use of RESTful API calls to communicate with the backend, allowing for seamless data exchange between the frontend and the backend.
